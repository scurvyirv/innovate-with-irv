<h3> Innovate with Irv showcases the skillsets I am developing using the Coding Bootcamp from UCI. Thus far, I have learned about the foundation of content, HTML, the styling of content, CSS, and the dynamic properties that create function and dimension, JavaScript. Therefore, this page is a dynamic reflection and juxtaposition of what I have learned, currently learn, and will learn. The beauty of coding is that learning is a constant, and therefore, so is the content that presents here.
